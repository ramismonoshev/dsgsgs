            <p><b>Name:</b> Estadio Santiago Bernabeu</p>
            <p><b>Established:</b> December 14, 1947</p>
            <p><b>Field size:</b> 105 m * 68 m (344 ft * 223 ft)</p>

            <p>At the beginning of the century, a group of players from the still-unreal football club Real Madrid began training on a piece of land in the center of Madrid owned by a marble merchant. After the founding of a professional football club in 1902, the team moved to Madrid's small sports arena.</p><br>
            <p>In 1924, the "Chamartin" stadium, with a capacity of 15,000 people, was sharpened at the site of this arena. There, the team performed for 23 years.</p>
            <img class="qwer" src="https://i.postimg.cc/x8C0QRHz/slides-pr-33-1374507072.jpg" alt="profile-image" style="width: 80%">
            <p></p>
            <p>In 1947, Real Madrid President Santiago Bernabeu issued an order to build a new stadium .. Construction lasted three years, and the cream match against Portuguese Belenenses on December 14, 1947, became the opening match for the new stadium. The meeting ended with the victory of "Real" with a score of 3: 1.</p><br>
            <p>The capacity of the new arena was 75,145 people (27.5 thousand seats and 47.5 thousand standing places), but don Santiago did not stop there - the construction of two more fully standing stands began very soon.</p>
            <img class="qwer" src="https://i.postimg.cc/XYvDgPWF/1551701712-414905-1551702021-noticia-normal.jpg" alt="profile-image" style="width: 80%">
            <p></p>
            <p>On June 19, 1954, the gaze of a Madrid football fan came up with a 125,000th giant (31,228 seats and 93,772 standing in the stands), not very long, by the way, bearing its former name. On January 4, 1955, by a decision of fans of the Royal Club, the stadium was named after the president of Real Madrid - Santiago Bernabeu.</p><br>
            <p>In this form, the arena lasted until the end of the twentieth century, when, firstly, four corner towers were erected, and secondly, UEFA decided to abolish standing places in stadiums, which reduced the maximum capacity of Santiago Bernabeu to the current 80,354 people.</p>
            <img class="qwer" src="https://i.postimg.cc/59SV7Dhk/1490136382-654458-1490136500-noticia-normal.jpg" alt="profile-image" style="width: 80%">
            <p></p>
            <p>In 2003, the arena was given the highest five-star status, and five years later, by UEFA decision, it received the right to host the Champions League final of the 2009/2010 season.</p><br>
            <p>It should be noted that throughout its existence, "Santiago Bernabeu" three times won the honor of holding the final match of the European Cup (in 1957, 1969 and 1980), as well as the decisive fights of the European Championship (1964) and the World Championship (1982).</p>

            <p></p>
            <p>On January 31, 2014, a plan for the reconstruction of the stadium was approved. However, the authorities of the capital of Spain regularly intervened in the process of starting work on the stadium. In the end, it became known that the Madrid City Hall will allow the reconstruction of Santiago Bernabeu only if the project does not provide for the expansion of the area occupied by the sports complex belonging to the club, stadiums.at.ua reported citing Spanish sources.</p><br>
            <p>It is known that back in 2012, the then head of Madrid, Ana Botella, endorsed a project to reconstruct the famous stadium and change the appearance of its facade overlooking Paseo de la Castellana Boulevard.</p><br>
            <p>However, later the project turned out to be "retouched" - changes were made to it, suggesting the expansion of the territory occupied by the complex from public lands.</p><br>
            <p>In compensation, Florentino Perez offered 10,028 square meters of land in the region of Carabanchel. The exchange was considered a settled matter, however, this was not documented: while negotiations continued and the conditions were satiated, elections were held and the power in the city changed.</p><br>
            <p>Manuela Carmen, the new head of the administration, had a different opinion about compensation. The judicial authorities, which joined in resolving the dispute, recognized the exchange as unequal and generally not in the public interest. Reconstruction of the stadium, thus, stopped, without even starting.</p><br>
            <p>Experts, considering the current situation, believe that a deal between the city hall and football clubs can still take place if the club will offer some other, "more interesting" ones for public use of the land as compensation.</p><br>
            <p>In May 2015, Real Madrid lost one lawsuit regarding the possible reconstruction of its stadium. Then opponents of Florentino Perez were environmentalists who believed that the expansion of the "Santiago Bernabeu" would harm the environment.</p>
